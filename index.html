			  <p><i><strong>Data Engineer - ML Engineer</strong></i></p> 
			  <p>"I discovered Python at the age of 16, and it sparked my interest in programming. This interest has grown over time, guiding me through the fields of AI and Data Engineering.</p>

			  <p>My journey has involved working with various technologies and tools. As an Azure Data Engineer , I gained experience with ETL pipelines using Azure Data Factory, worked with Azure Stack (including ADF, Azure Synapse, and Azure Databricks), and used PySpark and Pandas for data engineering tasks.</p>

			  <p>I've also explored data visualization using Seaborn and Plotly, and worked on machine learning models with PyTorch and scikit-learn.</p>

			  <p>I enjoy creating dashboards in Power BI and developing web scraping solutions. My aim is to help businesses leverage data and technology to achieve their goals.</p>

			  <p>Let's connect and explore how we can leverage these technologies to unlock new opportunities and achieve your goals."</p>
